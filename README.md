# GMXA-2024.6　-　GROMACS Analysis Supporting Library

This program assumes analysis using **GROMACS**.

## How to Compile

GMXA requires the **GROMACS library** to compile.  
Compilation is done using a **Makefile**.  
Please change the Makefile variable to your own directory when compiling, and then run:

`make install` is not intended.

After compilation, a library is created in the `lib` directory by default.  
Object files are created in the `obj` directory.

## Simple Compilation Flow

1. Rewrite the Makefile
2. `make build`
3. `make`

After compiling, you need to declare environment variables when linking your own program.  
This is because the GROMACS library used in this program is a **dynamic library**.

Details are provided in the README located at:

## GROMACS Version Compatibility

`.xtc` file loading has been confirmed to work with:
- GROMACS 2021
- GROMACS 2023

Operation with other GROMACS versions has not been confirmed.

## Platform Notes

Please specify the compiler according to the operating system you are using,  
as the binary format of object files differs between **Linux** and **macOS**.

## Cleaning

To delete the generated object files and libraries:
`make clean`

## How to Use

If you want to combine this program with your own program, you will need the **include path** and **library path** of this program.
