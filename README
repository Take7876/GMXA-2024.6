This program assumes analysis using gromacs.

[ How to conpile ]
GMXA requires the gromacs library to compile. Compilation is done using a Makefile.
Please change the Makefile variable to your own directory when compiling, and then make.
make install is not intended
After compilation with the make command, a library is created in the lib directory by default
Object files are created in the obj directory

[　Simple compilation flow　]

1 Rewriting Makefile
2 make

After compiling, you need to declare environment variables when linking your own program. This is because the gromacs library used in this program is a dynamic library.
Details are provided in the README located at src/gmxa/fileio.

Also, we have confirmed that .xtc file loading works with gromacs2021 and gromacs2023.
Operation of other gromacs versions has not been confirmed.

Please specify the compiler according to the operating system you are using, as the binary format of the object files created by compilers differs between Linux and macOS.

Delete the generated object files and libraries using the make clean command.

[ how to use ]
